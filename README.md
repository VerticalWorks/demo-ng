# Demo-Ng
## Required Reading
- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.
- Author: Michael Bowman
- Create Date: Sunday, 30-JAN-2022
- See GIT Logs for history

## Installation 
### *-Requirements*: ###  
This app was developd locally and bootstrapped with:
- Windows 10 Pro
- Node v16.13.2 
- Angular CLI 13.1.4

For simplicity sake, it would help to have those specific versions of the OS, Node and NG CLI when running locally.

### *-How To Install* ###
  
- Assuming you have cloned the repo locally, 
- For MAC: From a BASH Prompt run `yarn install` (pull down deps) 
- For PC: From a CMD Prompt run `yarn install` (pull down deps) 
## Build 
- Run `ng build` from a BASH or CMD shell to have Angular build the project 
## Development server
- Run `ng serve` from a `CMD Prompt` to build (if necessary) & launch the local dev server
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to test drive the app
- Changes to source-files trigger live updates

## Development Approach
- Used GIT (for obvious reasons)
- Used the NG schematic generator for most objects
- Tried to keep things simple
- Added a dataservice (injectable) and spinner for showing progress
- Did not add any test

## Summary of Assignment
- Thsi assignment took my a little longer than it should have.  I'm going to attribute the extra time to being a little under the weather.
- I would love to add AG-GRID to the mix, because it has some many kewl features, like sorting, filtering, drag-drop, pagination, etc.  It's a great grid for NG.
- In the real world I would have added injectors and route guards, and also NGXS for intra component communications and state mgmt.
- Libraries; an awesome way to develop and publish components in isolation.
- Lazy Loading; just makes sense.
## Proxy Settings
* NA
## Code scaffolding
BASH
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
